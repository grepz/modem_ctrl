* AT Command Format
  Here is a summary of the format and syntax of AT commands. Please note that
  most of the control characters are configurable, and the summary only uses the
  default control characters.

- AT commands are accepted by the modem only when in command mode. The modem can
  be forced into command mode with the #+++: Escape Sequence.

- Commands are grouped in command lines.

- Each command line must start with the #AT: Command Prefix and terminated
  with #<CR>: End-of-line Character. The only exception is the #A/: Repeat
  Last Command command.

- The body of a command line consists of visible ASCII characters (ASCII code
  32 to 126). Space (ASCII code 32) and ASCII control characters (ASCII code 0
  to 31) are ignored, with the exception of #<BS>: Backspace
  Character, #<CAN>: Cancel Character, and #<CR>: End-of-line Character.

- All characters preceding the #AT: Command Prefix are ignored.

- Interpretation / execution of the command line starts with the reception of
  the first (and also command-line terminating) #<CR>: End-of-line Character.

- Characters after the initial #AT: Command Prefix and before the #<CR>:
  End-of-line Character are interpreted as commands. With some exceptions,
  there can be many commands in one command line.

- Each of the basic commands consists of a single ASCII letter, or a single
  ASCII letter with a &prefix, followed by a numeric value. Missing numeric
  values are interpreted as 0 (zero).

- The following commands can't be followed by more commands on the command
  line. They must always be the last commands in a command line. If they are
  followed by other commands, these other commands are ignored. However, some
  of these commands take command modifiers and it is possible that a following
  command is accidentally interpreted as a command modifier. Therefore, care
  should be taken to not follow these commands with any more commands on the
  same command line. Instead, they should be placed in an own command line.
        #A: Answer Command
        #D: Dial Command
        #Z: Soft Reset Command

 - A command line can be edited if the terminating #<CR>: End-of-line Character
   has not ben entered, using the #<BS>: Backspace Character to delete one
   command line character at a time. The initial #AT: Command Prefix can't be
   edited/deleted (it has already been processed, because upon reception of
   the #AT: Command Prefix the modem immediately starts command line parsing
   and editing, but not execution).

- The modem echoes command lines and edits when #E: Command State Character
  Echo Selection is on (surprise, surprise :-)).

- When echo is on, #<BS>: Backspace Characters are echoed with a sequence of
  <BS> <BS> (backspace, space, backspace) to erase the last character in
  e.g. a terminal program on the DTE.

- A command line can be cancelled at any time before the terminating #<CR>:
  End-of-line Character by sending the #<CAN>: Cancel Character. No command in
  the command line is executed in this case.

- The #A: Answer Command and #D: Dial Command can also be cancelled as long as
  the handshake with the remote site has not been completed. Cancellation is
  done by sending an additional character. In theory, it doesn't matter which
  character. But care has to be taken that cancellation is not attempted when
  the handshake has already completed. In this case the modem has switched to
  on-line state (#Command State to On-line State) and the character will be
  send to the remote side. A save way to avoid this problem is to always use
  the #+++: Escape Sequence followed by going on-hock with the #H: Hook
  Command Options. If the modem is already in the on-line state, this will
  drop the connection. If the modem is still in the handshake phase the first
  character of the #+++: Escape Sequence will cancel the command (and the rest
  will be interpreted as a normal command line, doing no harm).

- Command line execution stops when the first command in the command line
  fails, or the whole command line has been executed. Every command before the
  failed command has been executed. Every command after the failed command and
  the failed command in the command line has not been executed.

- There is no particular indication which command in a command line failed,
  only that one failed. It is best to repeat the complete command line, or to
  first reset the modem to a defined state before recovering from a failure.

- A modem only accepts a new command line when the previous command line has
  been executed (half-duplex communication). Therefore, care should be taken
  to only send the next command line after the result code from the previous
  command line has been received.

* URC (pg. 30 of manual)
  To announce pending URC ME will do this:

- ME activates RING line(logic "1") for 1 second, i.e. RING line changesto
  physical low level. If several URC occurs in quick succession each URC
  triggers the RING line independently. The result: RING line may stay low
  for more then 1 sec.

- If AT command interface is busya "BREAK" will be sent immediately but the
  URC will not be issued until line is free.

** Common URC's

- URC1: <^SBC: Undervoltage>
- URC2: <^SBC: Overvoltage>

* Logic
** Start
   1. Look for ^SYSSTART. If not found, reset modem and try again.
   2. Set baud, set urc mode, result code.
   3. Configure SICS
   4. Configure SISS
